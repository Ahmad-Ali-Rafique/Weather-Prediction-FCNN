# Weather Prediction using Fully Connected Neural Networks (FCNN)

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for weather prediction using a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN). The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook, and it covers data loading, preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

## Project Description
The project uses a weather dataset that includes various meteorological features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. The pipeline includes:
1. **Data Loading**: Loading the weather dataset from a public source.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalizing and preparing the data to be suitable for the FCNN model.
3. **Model Training**: Building and training a Fully Connected Neural Network using TensorFlow/Keras.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's accuracy and other metrics on the test set, and visualizing the results.

### Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques such as normalization and feature engineering for optimal model performance.
- **Model Architecture**: Details of the FCNN layers, activation functions, and optimization techniques.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, loss, RMSE, and visualizations to assess the model's performance.
